I have expertise in various aspects of medical image computing, with a focus on multimodal image fusion and analysis of <em>ex vivo</em> Human tissue.  My area of expertise covers, among other things, Bayesian shape modelling, image segmentation and registration, and quantitative MRI. 

I offer scientific consultancies to academic research institutions (universities, hospitals, public research insitutes). The services I offer include project management, algorithmic design, software development, advanced visualization, training and mentoring of research staff.

Please contact me at <b>yael.balbastre <i>at</i> gmail.com</b> for enquiries and quotes.
