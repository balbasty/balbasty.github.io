I work on various aspects of medical image computing, with a focus on neuroimaging. I am particularly interested in generative probabilistic models, and how they can be integrated with machine learning techniques. I have worked, among other things, on Bayesian shape modelling, image segmentation and registration, and quantitative MRI. Recently, I have focused on multimodal image registration and vasculature segmentation, with the aim of building cellular-resolution atlases of the human brain.

I was a postdoctoral fellow with [Bruce Fischl](https://www.martinos.org/investigator/bruce-fischl/) at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and with [John Ashburner](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/computational-anatomy-team/) and [Martina Callaghan](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/physics-team/) at University College London. I completed my PhD at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, in the MIRCen and NeuroSpin laboratories, advised by [Thierry Delzescaux](https://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/english/Pages/Departments/MIRCen/ResearchThemes/brain-aging.aspx) and [Jean-Fran√ßois Mangin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin/unati.aspx).
