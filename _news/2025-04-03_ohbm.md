I will be presenting 
["A scalable computational framework for large-scale imaging of neural circuits"](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Abstracts/viewAbs?abs=2855)
in the [software demonstration](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Events/viewEv?ev=1925) session at 
[OHBM 2025](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4229).

I will also be presenting a poster on 
["SPM-python: Python Bindings for SPM25"](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Abstracts/viewAbs?abs=3662), a project led by Johan Medrano, 
and will participate to the ["30 years of SPM"](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Events/viewEv?ev=2568) roundtable.
