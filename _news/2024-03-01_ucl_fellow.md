I am starting a new adventure at University College London as a 
[Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/news/2023/10/early-career-researchers-funding-2023/), 
where I will work on _High-resolution spatiotemporal models of the brain across the lifespan for diagnosis and decision-making_.
