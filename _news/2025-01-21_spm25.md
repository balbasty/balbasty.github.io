A new major version of the [Statistical Parametric Mapping](https://github.com/spm/spm), SPM25, was released. 
This is the first major version of SPM since SPM12 (which, counter-intuitively, was released in 2014). 
It comes with a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12081) and includes, among other novelties, 
the [Multi-Brain (MB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02338) and [Factorisation-Based Image Labelling (FIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10326) toolboxes.
